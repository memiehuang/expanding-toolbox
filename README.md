What language, library, feature, service, or tool does this example demonstrate?
ChartJS

Why would a web developer want to use this technology? What problem(s) does it solve?

There are many benefits when it comes to using ChartJS. It provides six different interactive chart types that is run on HTML5. It allows you to visualize your data and allow your users to interactive with it through hovers and clicks. All of the charts are very flexibe and lightweight, so they will not increase your load time by a significant amount. The charts are also all responsive, so they will contribute to your mobile-first designs. Each chart are very customizable as you can change the color, interactives, size, and more. It will also provide a legend, so that your users know exactly what the information is representing.


Why might a web developer be cautious about using this technology? What limitations, weaknesses, or drawbacks does this technology have? Does it have an active development community or does it look abandoned? How many projects seem to use this technology? If there is a public GitHub repo for this, when was the last commit, how many open issues do they have, and are those issues being addressed?

Although ChartJS does have numerous ways for you to customize your chart, it is not as flexible as other data visualization languages. The data it represents must come in the traditional forms of bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs, and webs. It does allow you to represent your data in any other way, because there are only six different charts that you can use. ChartJS is also originally used with JQuery, so it seems a bit difficult to manipulate data when you are using Angular.

ChartJS does have a very active community. When you Google the data visualization language, there are endless amounts of links to different projects that people have created. With those links are examples of how ChartJS can be used and practice sites for you to learn the language. This shows that the language has an active community which can also be shown through their public GitHub repo. Their last commit was on November 16th, 2015 and they currently have 384 open issues that need to be dealt with. Each of those issues have comment threads on how they can fix those issues. It is obvious that the overall programming community is interested in this language due to the amount of people that are contributing to it. There are over 5000 forks on this repo.

What is your example site/app and how does it demonstrate the value of your chosen technology?

My example site uses a doughnut chart to represent the budgets of offices on a leadership team. I am currently the VP of Finance for the Panhellenic Association and I decided to start building a website that would allow each officer to send in reimbursement forms and have their budgets being adjusted accordingly. The current system we use is a paper-based system. My hope for this website would be that we can increase transparency of each officer's budget, so that the entire leadership team can have a better view of how our finances are going.

How should someone run your example? If you have hosted version of your example, provide a link to it, but also tell us anything we need to know in order to get the example working on our own machines. If your example requires the installation of tools or frameworks, explain how to do the install and provide links to any download sites. If your example requires the execution of commands in the terminal, note those here. If it requires a local web server in order to work, note that. If it requires an account on some web service and corresponding keys, provide a link to the service and explain how to configure the keys.
